# cpSteamScreenshots

I am a steam player, and I like take screenshots of some games to share to my friends or my networks.

The problem, Steam store the screenshots into a big folder with many folders, one per game installed. And the name of those folders are ID of game into Steam. So, every time that I take a screenshot I have to browse into many folders to get the image, and it is so exhausting.

This script, could be start at Task Manager on User Logged, and check the Steam userdata folder for any new file ( jpg ) and when detect it, copy that file to My Pictures folder.

I hope you enjoy this little a big first world issue solution.

To call the script:

.\cpSteamScreenShots.ps1 <DIR STEAM>  <DIR Mis Imagenes>
